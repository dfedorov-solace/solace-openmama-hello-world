# Solace OpenMAMA "Hello World"
## Simple application for OpenMAMA with Solace middleware bridge

This simple application will show you how to use __OpenMAMA__ to publish a message to a __Solace message router__.

To download and install __OpenMAMA__ see its [Quick Start Guide](http://www.openmama.org/content/quick-start-guide).

There are two ways you can get hold of the __Solace message router__:
- If your company has Solace message routers deployed, contact your middleware team to obtain the host name or IP address of a Solace message router to test against, a username and password to access it, and a VPN in which you can produce and consume messages.
- If you do not have access to a Solace message router, you will need to use the [Solace Virtual Router](http://www.solacesystems.com/products/solace-virtual-message-router). Go through the “[Set up a VMR](http://dev.solacesystems.com/get-started/vmr-setup-tutorials/setting-up-solace-vmr/)” tutorial to download and install it.
